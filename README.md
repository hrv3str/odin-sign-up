# Sign-In Form Project

This project is part of the curriculum for the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focusing on building a sign-in form. The objective of this project is to create a user interface where users can enter their credentials to sign in to a website or application.

## Technologies Used

In this project, the following technologies were used:

- HTML: for creating the structure and layout of the sign-in form.
- CSS: for styling the form elements and overall design.
- [Any additional technologies or libraries you may have used]

## Project Overview

The sign-in form project aims to create a user-friendly and responsive interface where users can enter their username and password to access a particular website or application. The project consists of the following components:

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file provides the structure and layout for the sign-in form. It includes input fields for the username and password, as well as buttons for submitting the form and performing other actions.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file is responsible for styling the form elements, including fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment. It ensures that the form looks visually appealing and consistent across different devices.

3. **[Optional] Server-side Integration**: Depending on the project requirements, you may need to integrate the sign-in form with a backend server to handle user authentication and store user data securely. This aspect is not covered in this particular project's scope.
