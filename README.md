Project Overview
The sign-in form project aims to create a user-friendly and responsive interface where users can enter their username and password to access a particular website or application. The project consists of the following components:

HTML Structure: The HTML file provides the structure and layout for the sign-in form. It includes input fields for the username and password, as well as buttons for submitting the form and performing other actions.

CSS Styling: The CSS file is responsible for styling the form elements, including fonts, colors, spacing, and alignment. It ensures that the form looks visually appealing and consistent across different devices.

[Optional] Server-side Integration: Depending on the project requirements, you may need to integrate the sign-in form with a backend server to handle user authentication and store user data securely. This aspect is not covered in this particular project's scope.
